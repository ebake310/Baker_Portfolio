# Portfolio Projects
Portfolio of independent projects I have completed to showcase my data analysis and data science skills. 

##### Analysis of Rock Climbing Crags in Wisconsin
Here [Wisconsin_climbing_analysis.ipynb](/Wisconsin_climbing_analysis.ipynb), I have analyzed all of the rock climbing routes in Wisconsin that are documented on the Mountain Project climbing website. The data from this website is combined with geological data of the bedrock type throughout Wisconsin, plus data on the distance of each crag from Madison, WI which was obtained using the Open Street Map API. The goals of this project were to assess the locations and types of rock climbing in Wisconsin, to see if a model can be developed to predict how much climbers like a route (as indicated by the star rating), and to determine which crags would be the most suitable to climb at based on a number of criteria.

##### Cases of Lyme Disease in the US
The [Lyme_Analysis.ipynb](/Lyme_Analysis.ipynb) project contains an analysis of Lyme disease cases in the United States from 2000 to 2019. Data on Lyme cases by county were obtained from the CDC website and combined with maps and census data obtained from the US census website. The datasets are merged and used to assess the prevelance of Lyme disease both at the county and state level, how cases are change over time and spatially, and how changes in Lyme cases relate to population.
