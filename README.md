# Portfolio Projects
Portfolio of independent projects I have completed to showcase my data analysis and data science skills. 

##### Case of Lyme Disease in the US
The [Lyme_Analysis.ipynb](/Lyme_Analysis.ipynb) project contains an analysis of Lyme disease cases in the United States from 2000 to 2019. Data on Lyme cases by county were obtained from the CDC website and combined with maps and census data obtained from the US census website. The datasets are merged and used to assess the prevelance of Lyme disease both at the county and state level, how cases are change over time and spatially, and how changes in Lyme cases relate to population.
